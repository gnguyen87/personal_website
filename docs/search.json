    "section": "",
    "text": "You may have probably seen people lifting different weights in the gym. But why do people even lift? There are numerous reasons for lifting but one of the most common reasons is to become stronger, while others do lifting for a competition such as powerlifting. Powerlifting is a strength sport that has been part of the Olympics Games since 1896 and consists of three attempts to achieve the maximum weight on each of the three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. During these competitions, some participants lift heavier weights than others. So we wonder, what accounts for this difference in a competitor’s performance? Could it be merely because of biological factors? Or are there any other factors that might impact a person’s ability to lift a certain weight?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ever since the “Golden Age” of cinema in the 1930s that marked silent film a thing of the past, the film industry has witnessed unparalleled success and growth. From the first technicolor movies like The Wizard of Oz and Gone With The Wind to the computationally animated The Matrix, Jurassic Park, and the first fully computer-animated film, Toy Story, the industry of motion pictures has contributed greatly not only to technology but also the global economy. Especially in the current challenging economy and there has been a sharp decline in theater audience—[shrinking by half in the last 4 years]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb), film distributors are hesitant to take on a movie unless they can see its success first hand. Therefore, box-office, or the entire earnings generated through movie ticket sales, has been recognized as one of the primary indicators to compare film success. Many rely on it to decide whether to both produce and watch a film. However, are high grossing movies actually… good? If so, what else can we use to measure them?"

The game has 3 levels of difficulty: easy (5 pairs, 10 attempts), medium (10 pairs, 20 attempts), and difficult (15 pairs, 30 attempts). The game begins with all cards flipped upside down. Upon clicking one of the cards, it flips face-side-up to reveal the pokemon it pertains to. The goal of the each round is to find the matching card, with 15 total pairs, for the card flipped. Upon the second card being clicked, if it is not a correct match, the cards will flip back over to hide the pokemon. However, if they match, the two cards will be removed from the screen. The goal of the game is to remove all pairs before the given time and under the limited number of attempts."

Within the context of this dataset, educational attainment points to the proportion of the town population that successfully completes a certain educational level.\",\n      \"From these graphs, I found that the educational attainment is suggested to be much lower in income-deprived towns. Furthermore, this trend performs worse and worse the higher the educational level. More interestingly, UK towns that tend to be of higher deprivation in terms of income tend to be bigger-sized. When examining the correlation between education score, which is based on the key stage 4 (14-16 year-olds) and achieved proportion of town in each key stage, as in those who successfully completed a certain key stage, I found that the higher the achieved town proportion in all key stages, the higher the key stage 4 education score and vice versa. In other words, towns with higher achived proportion in early stages will score higher in the education score in key stage 4, and towns with higher education scores in key stage 4 have higher achieved proportion rate in high-school and university. These findings suggest social and geoeconomic factors such as the relationship between town size and town economic performance as well as early access to and achievement in education are imperative to the town overall educational attainment level.\",\n      \"Source: The dataset this week comes from The UK Office for National Statistics.

Part of the development team, we translate our research findings, both from Blocks4All, other commerical/accessible educational technology (Scratch, Torino, and TIP-toy) and accessible design frameworks, into child-friendly Help, Settings, and Robot Pairing screens in Figma (mock-ups) & Swift (iPad App).\nDuring our application design and development, we also implemented QA and alpha testing to discover critical bugs, resolve warnings as well as add new learning features while improving compatibility with iOS assistive technology and UI efficiency."
