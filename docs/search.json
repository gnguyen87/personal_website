Within the context of this dataset, educational attainment points to the proportion of the town population that successfully completes a certain educational level.\",\n      \"From these graphs, I found that the educational attainment is suggested to be much lower in income-deprived towns. Furthermore, this trend performs worse and worse the higher the educational level. More interestingly, UK towns that tend to be of higher deprivation in terms of income tend to be bigger-sized. When examining the correlation between education score, which is based on the key stage 4 (14-16 year-olds) and achieved proportion of town in each key stage, as in those who successfully completed a certain key stage, I found that the higher the achieved town proportion in all key stages, the higher the key stage 4 education score and vice versa. In other words, towns with higher achived proportion in early stages will score higher in the education score in key stage 4, and towns with higher education scores in key stage 4 have higher achieved proportion rate in high-school and university. These findings suggest social and geoeconomic factors such as the relationship between town size and town economic performance as well as early access to and achievement in education are imperative to the town overall educational attainment level.\",\n      \"Source: The dataset this week comes from The UK Office for National Statistics.

This might be due to the small size of my dataset and data points being too Ill-separated. 9 clusters, consequently, cannot give us the best grouping and interpretability for my dataset. Rather, the algorithm might be creating clusters that capture noise or irrelevant patterns in the data, leading to inflated silhouette scores. Hence, given the size and context of the dataset , which results in difficulties when choosing K, and an unreasonable value of K using the silhouette method, I’ll continue my analysis using a hierarchical clustering method, which I believe is a better approach."

    "section": "Hierarchical Clustering",
    "text": "Hierarchical Clustering\nAccording to the hierarchical clustering model, roughly 4 natural clusters can be seen in the dendogram. 4 seems like an appropriate number of clusters given the fact that the dataset contains only 41 observations which could lead to clusters with roughly 10 counties each on average. Furthermore, maximum distance within clusters is 7.5, which is where cluster 2 (colored in purple) fuses, whereas other 3 clusters fuse at roughly a height of 6. Given the context of the data with maximum distance betIen any two pairs of counties in the dendogram being 10, the height of 6 allows to reduce amount of variability by 40 percent within each cluster. Thus, I examine 4 clusters in the dataset.\nHierarchical clustering further allows for open and different interpretation of the dendogram while visualizing structures within the clusters. Cluster 3 (in green) includes sub-groups whereas cluster 2 (in purple) is fused at the highest point which shows greater variability within the cluster. I further used complete linkage since I want all my clusters to have similar characteristics.\n\nThe first cluster of counties is not a farming cluster and does not specialize in growing any crops. HoIver, this is the cluster with the highest average household size and contains the second highest number of counties (11). Therefore, it is probably a cluster of urban counties. Counties such as Mombasa, Garissa, Wajir, etc that are included in cluster 1 are all urban cities or towns.\n\nCluster 2,3, and 4 are farming oriented counties that each specialize in a variety of crops.\nCluster 2 is the smallest cluster with 4 counties and specializes in cashew, coconut and mango production.\nCluster 3 is the largest cluster with 20 counties and primarily produce avocado along with tea and mango.\nCluster 4 produces avocado, coffee, khatmiraa, macadamia, and tea.\nThe male and female gender distribution is roughly the same across all clusters. HoIver, cluster 1 has the largest proportion of intersex population with cluster 2 and 3 having loIst proportion.\n\nConsidering the size of my dataset, I would move forward with my Hierarchical Clustering Model with 4 clusters as the approach to identify similarities betIen each county in Kenya. Furthermore, as seen in the hierarchical clustering map, clusters of counties identified are also geographically close to each other. This approach gives meaningful clusters in terms of agricultural expertise and geographical locations (urban vs rural)."

When observing my score plot, there is a cluster of cities that have a large positive PC1 value betIen 2.5 and 5. For example, mandera, mombasa, turkana, marsabit, wajir, isiolo, and garissa. This means that these observations either have a large negative Farming PC value, a large negative crop feature PC value (e.g., Avocado, Coffee, and Tea), a large positive Male PC value, and/or a large negative Female PC value.\n\nThese observations overlap with my findings from my K-Means model results, wherein cluster 1 include counties such as Mombasa, Garissa, Wajir,…- which are all urban cities or towns. In other words, this cluster of counties is not a farming cluster and does not specialize in growing any crops i.e. a large negative Farming and/or crop-related features PC value.\n\nPrinciple component 2: PC2 is driven by fruit/nut-bearing crop features such as Citrus, Mango, Coconut, and Cashew Nut (negative contribution). When observing my score plot, there is a cluster of cities that have a large negative PC2 value betIen -3 and -5. For example makueni, kilifi, kwale, and lamu. This means that these observations either have a large positive Citrus, Mango, Coconut, and/or Cashew Nut PC value.\n\n\n\nThese observations overlap with my findings from my K-Means model results as Ill, wherein cluster 4 include counties such as Makueni, Kilifi, Kwale, and Lamu which are scounties that pecializes in cashew, coconut and mango production."

    "text": "You may have probably seen people lifting different weights in the gym. But why do people even lift? There are numerous reasons for lifting but one of the most common reasons is to become stronger, while others do lifting for a competition such as powerlifting. Powerlifting is a strength sport that has been part of the Olympics Games since 1896 and consists of three attempts to achieve the maximum weight on each of the three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. During these competitions, some participants lift heavier weights than others. So we wonder, what accounts for this difference in a competitor’s performance? Could it be merely because of biological factors? Or are there any other factors that might impact a person’s ability to lift a certain weight?"

    "text": "Ever since the “Golden Age” of cinema in the 1930s that marked silent film a thing of the past, the film industry has witnessed unparalleled success and growth. From the first technicolor movies like The Wizard of Oz and Gone With The Wind to the computationally animated The Matrix, Jurassic Park, and the first fully computer-animated film, Toy Story, the industry of motion pictures has contributed greatly not only to technology but also the global economy. Especially in the current challenging economy and there has been a sharp decline in theater audience—[shrinking by half in the last 4 years]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb), film distributors are hesitant to take on a movie unless they can see its success first hand. Therefore, box-office, or the entire earnings generated through movie ticket sales, has been recognized as one of the primary indicators to compare film success. Many rely on it to decide whether to both produce and watch a film. However, are high grossing movies actually… good? If so, what else can we use to measure them?"

Upon clicking one of the cards, it flips face-side-up to reveal the pokemon it pertains to. The goal of the each round is to find the matching card, with 15 total pairs, for the card flipped. Upon the second card being clicked, if it is not a correct match, the cards will flip back over to hide the pokemon. However, if they match, the two cards will be removed from the screen.
