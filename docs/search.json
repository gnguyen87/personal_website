    "text": "A collaborative project, our primary objective is to explore the variables related to depression by specifically looking at an individual’s physical activity levels and the socioeconomic conditions of participants. The former will help our team identify if physical activity promotes a healthier mind, while the latter variable will help identify a trend on if and how financial situations impact one’s mental health. In sum, our final goal is to better understand the relationship between these factors so as to identify potential risk factors or protective factors that could help indicate mental health outcomes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "You may have probably seen people lifting different weights in the gym. But why do people even lift? There are numerous reasons for lifting but one of the most common reasons is to become stronger, while others do lifting for a competition such as powerlifting. Powerlifting is a strength sport that has been part of the Olympics Games since 1896 and consists of three attempts to achieve the maximum weight on each of the three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. During these competitions, some participants lift heavier weights than others. So we wonder, what accounts for this difference in a competitor’s performance? Could it be merely because of biological factors? Or are there any other factors that might impact a person’s ability to lift a certain weight?"

For more details on the project, visit our project website!\nThroughout and in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a notable shift towards incorporating technology into education. While educational technology has increased accessibility and flexibility in uncertain times, there are potential consequences due to the inherent lack of social connection and physical activities in online learning. In this project, we aim to investigate this increasing prevalence of educational technology and their impact on the well-being of individuals within this evolving educational landscape."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ever since the “Golden Age” of cinema in the 1930s that marked silent film a thing of the past, the film industry has witnessed unparalleled success and growth. From the first technicolor movies like The Wizard of Oz and Gone With The Wind to the computationally animated The Matrix, Jurassic Park, and the first fully computer-animated film, Toy Story, the industry of motion pictures has contributed greatly not only to technology but also the global economy. Especially in the current challenging economy and there has been a sharp decline in theater audience—[shrinking by half in the last 4 years]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb), film distributors are hesitant to take on a movie unless they can see its success first hand. Therefore, box-office, or the entire earnings generated through movie ticket sales, has been recognized as one of the primary indicators to compare film success. Many rely on it to decide whether to both produce and watch a film. However, are high grossing movies actually… good? If so, what else can we use to measure them?"

    "text": "Pokemon Card Game is a multi-level memory card game developed in Java with kilt-graphics API to enhance concentration and critical thinking skills in 5-8 youth. The game has 3 levels of difficulty: easy (5 pairs, 10 attempts), medium (10 pairs, 20 attempts), and difficult (15 pairs, 30 attempts). The game begins with all cards flipped upside down. Upon clicking one of the cards, it flips face-side-up to reveal the pokemon it pertains to. The goal of the each round is to find the matching card, with 15 total pairs, for the card flipped. Upon the second card being clicked, if it is not a correct match, the cards will flip back over to hide the pokemon. However, if they match, the two cards will be removed from the screen. The goal of the game is to remove all pairs before the given time and under the limited number of attempts."
