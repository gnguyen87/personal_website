Besides all coursework projects, I endeavor to participate in *Tidy Tuesday*, a weekly data analysis project in the R programming language. It's part of the broader #TidyTuesday initiative, which was started by the R4DS (R for Data Science) .

By being part of this online learning community, I am constantly enriching myself in new visualizations and data narratives while being updated on the current social, economic, and political landscape!
