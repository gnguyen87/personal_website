Since the beginning of my internship as a *Data Engineer* at *Education Analytics*, I have become more and more interested in the world of DE. This is my first project in which I built a complete automated ELT pipeline. This pipeline involves a DAG on **Apache Airflow** set up to extract education data from Urban Institute's API, serialize the API's response into a JSON payload, as well as load the data into a **PostgresSQL Database** (DBeaver). It also entails desiging and modeling a dimensional data warehouse using **dbt**, transforming raw JSON data into clean, human-readable tables to support analytical queries, improving data accessibility for non-technical users downstream.

This is part of my onboarding training designed by EA.
