# dbt

dbt (data build tool) is a popular open-source tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform data in their data warehouse using SQL. It simplifies the process of building, testing, and maintaining data transformation pipelines, making it easier to create and manage data models.

# dbt Fundamentals

Course Description: Learn the foundational steps of transforming data in dbt Cloud. Start by connecting dbt Cloud to a data warehouse and Git repository, then explore key concepts like modeling, sources, testing, documentation, and deployment. Get hands-on by building a model and running tests in dbt Cloud. Course duration is approximately 5 hours.
