You may have probably seen people lifting different weights in the gym. But why do people even lift? There are numerous reasons for lifting but one of the most common reasons is to become stronger, while others do lifting for a competition such as powerlifting. Powerlifting is a strength sport that has been part of the Olympics Games since 1896 and consists of three attempts to achieve the maximum weight on each of the three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. During these competitions, some participants lift heavier weights than others. So we wonder, what accounts for this difference in a competitorâ€™s performance? Could it be merely because of biological factors? Or are there any other factors that might impact a person's ability to lift a certain weight?
