In this paper, I conducted 3 unsupervised learning analysis methods o uncover significant agricultural, demographic, and geographic patterns across 41 counties in Kenya.

From my findings through investigating the first 2 PCs and my Hierarchical Clustering Model, I observed that my data exhibits high variability, high separatedness, and rather complex patterns. This indicate that I might need to retain more variability to capture the nuances in the data. Therefore, I would suggest moving forward with 4 PCs, with which I will retain 75% of my original information.From my findings through investigating the first 2 PCs and my Hierarchical Clustering Model, I observed that my data exhibits high variability, high separatedness, and rather complex patterns.
