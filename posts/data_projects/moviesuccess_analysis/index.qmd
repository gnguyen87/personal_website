Ever since the “Golden Age” of cinema in the 1930s that marked silent film a thing of the past, the film industry has witnessed unparalleled success and growth. From the first technicolor movies like The Wizard of Oz and Gone With The Wind to the computationally animated The Matrix, Jurassic Park, and the first fully computer-animated film, Toy Story, the industry of motion pictures has contributed greatly not only to technology but also the global economy. Especially in the current challenging economy and there has been a sharp decline in theater audience—[shrinking by half in the last 4 years]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb), film distributors are hesitant to take on a movie unless they can see its success first hand.
