I utilize frameworks such as machine learning, linear and logistic regression in order to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), full-stack analysis, dashboards, and funnel analysis. Leveraging my fluency in R, SQL, Tableau, and Python, I seek to answer important questions of diverse topics, centering around education, health, and business. As a self-taught data analyst, I am constantly captivating my growth, training, and working on more and more projects, so visit again soon for newer and more insightful, focused projects!
