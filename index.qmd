Hello there! I'm **Na Nguyen**, a dedicated student pursuing a double major in **Data Science and International Studies** with a disciplinary focus in **Educational Studies** at Macalester College (Class of '25). I am always acquiring new technical skills, applying my academic training, and immersing myself in various community-based roles and projects. Currently, I am working as a **Data Engineer Associate** at **Education Analytics**, an NPO dedicated to accessible and affordable education data services.

Explore my portfolio where I am constantly investigating how education, health, industry, and technology as separate entities as well as ways they can converge!
