Hello there! I'm **Na Nguyen**, a dedicated student pursuing a double major in **Data Science and International Studies** with a disciplinary focus in **Educational Studies** at Macalester College (Class of '25). An aspiring educator and researcher, I endeavour to fight for educational equity and social justice through data-driven insights.

My journey is defined by a strong foundation in project management, curriculum development, and community outreach. Alongside, I possess proficient skills in software development and data analysis. 

Explore my portfolio where I am constantly investigating how education, health, industry, and technology as separate entities as well as ways they can synergize!
